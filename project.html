            <h3>When it comes to cloud<br>storage, many users feel it<br>is not specialized enough for photograph storage<br>alone. Additionally, the<br>client requested the ability<br>to upload, save, organize,<br>create, share, and<br>collaborate.

        <h2>COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS</h2>
          <h3>FLICKR, SMUGMUG, GOOGLE DRIVE</h3>
          <p>The SWOT analysis helped me to determine these companies strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats.<br>
            Some key takeaways that Photosphere could benefit from were:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>SmugMug offers a free trial for two weeks, then no free options. Photosphere will offer a great free option.</li>
            <li>SmugMug’s logo isn’t spectacularly memorable or strong. Photosphere will have a memorable, strong logo.</li>
            <li>Flickr’s icons do not have words to go along, which can be confusing. Photosphere’s icons will have words by them.</li>
            <li>Flickr autoloads when scrolling, so reaching the footer feels impossible. Photosphere’s interface will not feature this issue.</li>
            <li>Google Drive has strong, simple, and bold branding. Photosphere will have strong, simple branding as well.</li>
            <li>Google Drive is not specific to photography. Photosphere will be specific to photography.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>If I were to do anything differently, I would analyze one last photography-specific site. I would also try to tap into<br>
            SmugMug’s portfolio-style presentation for professional photographers.</p>

              that I had about users cloud storage needs. Users stated that they were using cloud storage for both personal and professional<br>
              purposes. In addition to that, they shared that their biggest frustrations were both sharing files and saving files.</p>

                challenging to just focus on the high priority stories, but ranking them helped me to keep the scope of the project in mind.</p>

                  wireframes was (as you can see) far too large.</p>

                    function. After thorough testing and user feedback, I was able to make a plan for editing Photosphere further to relieve it of its<br>
                    kinks. Some notes from the analysis include:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>The organize aspect was lumped in with the upload option, which seemed a bit sticky and incomplete.</li>
                    <li>The question was asked afterward: How would one be able to move a photo between albums after uploading?</li>
                    <li>Users had positive comments on the logo and visuals.</li>

                    sketching, I used Adobe Illustrator to digitize many concepts. Through preference testing I was able to iterate further, and users<br>
                    helped Photosphere realize it’s perfect, final logo.</p>

                <p>This project was incredible to direct from concept to interactive, high fidelity prototype. A big takeaway from working on this is<br>
                  that “Test early and often” is no joke. I would have started testing even earlier, and would have tested more. I learned that just<br>
                  because I can create all icons and assets from scratch, doesn’t  mean that I should. Time is a big factor. I also learned that there<br>
                  is a resource online for almost anything. And that testing users is more than just listening to their words, but also reading their<br>
                  body language and watching their process intensely.</p>
